[[MP3] MP3 Errata

A lot has changed in MP3. This is a master post to track all errors and clarifications made for MP3. Please pay attention to stay up to date.

* [10/20 20:45] Please update the Makefile in your `usr/` directory to remove all files from `ALL_TARGETS` except `hello`. The remaining files were used for testing but were not provided in your repo. Additionally, please change `UMODE := 1` to `UMODE := 0` for CP1, as `hello` will not build correctly unless this is properly set.
* [10/21 00:34] The Doxygen comment for `ktfs_flush` incorrectly states the return value is `int`. The correct return type is `void`. If an error occurs in `ktfs_flush`, you should do nothing and return immediately.
* [10/21 07:04] For `vioblk_storage_store` and `vioblk_storage_fetch`, writes & reads that exceed the end of the block device should be truncated. Do not return a negative error code in these scenarios.
* [10/21 07:23] For `ramdisk_open`, you should return negative error code when an error occurs. For `ramdisk_close`, if there is an error, you should return immediately.
* [10/21 15:17] In `vioblk_storage_store` and `vioblk_storage_fetch`, writes & reads whose `bytecnt` are not a multiple of `blksz` should be rounded down to the nearest `blksz`. The number of bytes written & read should equal the return value.
