 * Allocates memory for the pipe struct and initializes all necessary parts for the pipe
 * You will have to modify the passed in pointers to point to the relevant pipe io interfaces. For
 * example, you will have to create a pipe write interface that will be referenced by the wioptr.
 * For this we also have intentionally chosen to give you freedom with how your pipes implementation
 * works internally. The following are additional details regarding implementation. You should use a
 * simple buffer of PAGE_SIZE that you can allocate using your alloc_phys_page function We recommend
 * head and tail pointers to keep track of read and write positions. This buffer is the channel in
 * which we write based on the tail and read based on the head. You will also have to use condition
 * variables to have the reader signal the writer and vice versa. This signaling has to be done on
 * updates to the buffer so that the other can properly respond. This signaling is necessary because
 * the reader and writer must sleep while they are waiting for the others actions. You should note
 * that the reader should only be forced to wait if a writer exists, and a writer should only be
 * forced to wait if a reader exists. When closing the reader or writer you should also free the
 * buffer if it is possible (consider why it would not always be possible). This implementation
 * facilitates one-way communication, allowing messages to be sent from one program to another, kind
 * of like a mailbox.
